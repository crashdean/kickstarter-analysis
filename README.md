Analysis of Kickstarter for new theater play.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    
    
    The Kickstarter analysis project was designed to help a up and coming play wright 
Louise determine if her play "Fever" will be successful in raising funds.   The overall 
budget for the play was set at $10,000.   The data used for the analysis will provide a 
better idea if the play "Fever" has the same or greater success rate than previous fund 
raisers.   Through the use of Excel, we can manipulate the data of the previous fund 
raisers and chart the outcome data to success and also the outcome percent to projected 
amount of funds raised.   We can then see when is the best time to start a fund raiser 
and the success of the projected budget.
### Purpose

## Analysis and Challenges

     The analysis for this assignment were created using existing data from kickstarter fund raisers existing 
in a Excel spreadsheet.   We used the following categories for our analysis.

* Goals
* Outcomes
* Launched_At
* Category and Subcategory

For the first analysis, we used outcome and launch date to create a PivotTable.   In this PivotTable, we 
populated the columns field with the outcome column.   The rows field with populated using the date created 
column; which we converted from Excel date to standard date first.   Outcomes was selected for value, and we 
fitlered the table using parent category and years after ungrouping it form launch date.   The PivotTable was then 
filtered for the theater subcategory only and all years were used for the launch date.   A PivotChart was the 
created using the finished PivotTable.   The PivotChart showed which months had a greater success for fund raising.
