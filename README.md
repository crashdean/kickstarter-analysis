Analysis of Kickstarter for new theater play.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
    
    
    The Kickstarter analysis project was designed to help a up and coming play wright 
Louise determine if her play "Fever" will be successful in raising funds.   The overall 
budget for the play was set at $10,000.   The data used for the analysis will provide a 
better idea if the play "Fever" has the same or greater success rate than previous fund 
raisers.   Through the use of Excel, we can manipulate the data of the previous fund 
raisers and chart the outcome data to success and also the outcome percent to projected 
amount of funds raised.   We can then see when is the best time to start a fund raiser 
and the success of the projected budget.
