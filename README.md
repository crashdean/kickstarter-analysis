Analysis of Kick Starter for new theater play.
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
     The Kick Starter analysis project was designed to help a up and coming play wright Louise determine if her play "Fever" will be successful in raising funds.   The overall budget for the play was set at $10,000.   The data used for the analysis will provide a better idea if the play "Fever" has the same or greater success rate than previous fund raisers.   Through the use of Excel, we can manipulate the Data of the previous fund raisers and chart the outcome data to success and also the outcome percent to projected amount of funds raised.   e can then see when is the best time to start a fund raiser and the success of the projected budget.
